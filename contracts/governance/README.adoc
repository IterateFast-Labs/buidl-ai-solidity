# On-Chain Governance (OpenZeppelin-Fission Adaptation)

> **Note**  
> This document is adapted from [OpenZeppelin’s Governance Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance) and includes additional commentary for **Fission**’s on-chain governance use cases. Many sections remain consistent with OpenZeppelin’s reference, ensuring full compatibility with standard Governor contracts.

## Overview

This directory (or section of your repository) contains primitives for **on-chain governance**, leveraging OpenZeppelin’s Governor pattern. Through **Fission**’s AI Delegate or other advanced use cases, you can deploy easily customizable voting and proposal workflows that remain compatible with existing OpenZeppelin tooling.

---

## Governor

OpenZeppelin’s modular **Governor** system allows the deployment of on-chain voting protocols similar to Compound’s Governor Alpha & Bravo—plus additional features—thanks to its easily customizable structure:

- **Core Contract (`Governor`)**  
  The abstract, foundational contract containing all the logic and primitives needed for an on-chain voting system. You must inherit from `Governor` and select the modules (or write custom ones) that define:
  - Where voting power comes from (e.g., token-based, NFT-based).  
  - How to count votes (simple, fractional, overriding).  
  - Whether to add a time-delay (`Timelock`) or specialized functionalities (e.g., super quorum).

> **Tip**  
> For a straightforward experience, use the [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#governor) to set up your Governor with basic configurations.

> **Guide**  
> A written tutorial on how to build your own on-chain governance can be found in [OpenZeppelin’s “How to set up on-chain governance”](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance).

Below is an overview of the modules available in OpenZeppelin, alongside notes on how they can integrate with **Fission** or other advanced workflows.

---

### Votes Modules

These modules determine the **source of voting power**—and in some cases, the quorum needed.

- **`GovernorVotes`**  
  Extracts voting weight from an `IVotes`-compliant contract (often an ERC20Votes or ERC721Votes token).

- **`GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`**  
  Extends `GovernorVotes` to set quorum as a fraction of the total token supply.

- **`GovernorVotesSuperQuorumFraction`**  
  Combines `GovernorSuperQuorum` with `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction` to define a super quorum fraction of the total token supply.

---

### Counting Modules

These modules define the **valid voting options** and how votes are tallied:

- **`GovernorCountingSimple`**  
  A straightforward mechanism with three choices: `Against`, `For`, and `Abstain`.

- **`GovernorCountingFractional`**  
  Allows partial usage of voting power distributed arbitrarily across the three choices.

- **`GovernorCountingOverridable`**  
  Builds upon `GovernorCountingSimple`, letting delegatees override delegates while the vote is live. Must be used with `VotesExtended`.

---

### Timelock Extensions

Timelock modules introduce a **delay** before governance decisions can be executed. They require a “queue step” before execution, typically meaning that a separate timelock contract holds relevant assets or permissions.

- **`GovernorTimelockAccess`**  
  Connects with an `AccessManager`. Governance proposals must be scheduled and executed through the manager’s “schedule + execute” workflow.

- **`GovernorTimelockControl`**  
  Integrates a `TimelockController`, enabling multiple proposers and executors (in addition to the Governor contract itself).

- **`GovernorTimelockCompound`**  
  Adapts the Compound Timelock contract to the Governor context.

---

### Other Extensions

Miscellaneous modules to further customize governance behavior:

- **`GovernorStorage`**  
  Stores proposal details on-chain and provides enumerability. This is sometimes valuable on L2s where on-chain storage can be cheaper than calldata.

- **`GovernorSettings`**  
  Allows updating of governance parameters (voting delay, voting period, proposal threshold) through governance proposals themselves—no separate contract upgrade required.

- **`GovernorPreventLateQuorum`**  
  Forces a minimum voting duration **after** quorum is reached, preventing last-minute vote swings.

- **`GovernorProposalGuardian`**  
  Lets a designated guardian cancel proposals at any stage. If unassigned, the proposal’s author (or another specified role) can act as the guardian.

- **`GovernorSuperQuorum`**  
  Extends `Governor` to use a **super quorum** mechanism, whereby proposals with extremely high support move to the `Succeeded` state before the official proposal deadline.

---

### Functions to Implement

Your custom Governor inherits from `Governor` and must implement the following **virtual** functions:

- **`votingDelay()`**  
  Time (in ERC-6372 clock terms) between proposal submission and the start of voting. This can provide a buffer for voters to adjust their delegations or acquire tokens.

- **`votingPeriod()`**  
  Time (in ERC-6372 clock) from the start of voting until it ends.

- **`quorum(uint256 timepoint)`**  
  Required votes for a proposal to pass. Includes a `timepoint` parameter so the quorum can adapt over time to reflect changes in total supply or external conditions.

> **Note**  
> Core Governor functions do **not** include built-in access control. Overload them to introduce role checks (e.g., only certain roles can cancel proposals). By default, `_cancel` is internal—if you need external cancellation, you must expose it with your chosen access control.

# Timelock

In on-chain governance, a **Timelock** enforces a delay between proposal passage and its execution. OpenZeppelin’s [TimelockController](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/governance#TimelockController) is a flexible contract for scheduling and managing operations. It can be used with or without a `Governor`.

## Terminology

- **Operation**: A transaction (or batch of transactions) subject to the timelock. Must be scheduled by a proposer and executed by an executor, with a minimum enforced delay.  
- **Operation Status**:
  - **Unset**: Not tracked by the timelock.  
  - **Waiting**: Scheduled, but the timer has not yet expired.  
  - **Ready**: Scheduled, and the timer has expired.  
  - **Pending**: Covers both the `Waiting` and `Ready` states.  
  - **Done**: Successfully executed.  

- **Predecessor**: (Optional) dependency between operations. If an operation has a predecessor, it cannot be executed before that predecessor is `Done`.  
- **Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Manages proposers/executors. Typically, you want the timelock itself to be the admin for a self-governed system.  
  - **Proposer**: Schedules and cancels operations. A crucial role, generally controlled by a DAO or multisig.  
  - **Executor**: Executes operations once they become `Ready`. This can be assigned broadly (including the zero address to allow anyone to execute) or restricted.

---

## Operation Structure

When using the `TimelockController`, operations can be **simple** (one transaction) or **batched** (several transactions executed atomically). Each operation includes:

- **Target**: The contract to call.  
- **Value**: Ether (in wei) to send with the transaction. Usually `0`.  
- **Data**: Encoded function call data (`functionSelector + parameters`).  
- **Predecessor**: An operation ID upon which this one depends (use `bytes32(0)` if none).  
- **Salt**: A random or unique value preventing collisions in otherwise identical operations.

---

## Operation Lifecycle

1. **Unset** → **Pending**: A proposer calls `schedule` (or `scheduleBatch`) to add the operation.  
2. **Pending** + **Waiting** → **Ready**: Time passes until the timelock delay expires.  
3. **Ready** → **Done**: An executor calls `execute` (or `executeBatch`) to finalize the operation’s transactions.  
4. **Cancel**: A proposer may cancel a `Pending` operation, reverting it to `Unset`. It can then be rescheduled if desired.

Query helper functions:
- `isOperationPending(bytes32 id)`  
- `isOperationReady(bytes32 id)`  
- `isOperationDone(bytes32 id)`

---

## Roles

### Admin
- Grants and revokes the Proposer/Executor roles.  
- For self-governed timelocks, the admin role is assigned to the timelock itself.  
- If you grant Admin to an external address, ensure you eventually revoke it for trust minimization.

### Proposer
- Schedules and cancels operations.  
- Must be assigned to a reliable entity (e.g., a DAO, multisig).  
- **Warning**: Having multiple proposers can cause conflicts if they cancel or override each other’s proposals.

### Executor
- Executes queued operations when the timelock is `Ready`.  
- Often given to the same entity as the Proposer (like a DAO or multisig).  
- Can also be assigned to the zero address to let anyone execute operations after the delay.

## Summary

By combining **Governor** (and its modules/extensions) with **TimelockController**, you can implement robust, customizable on-chain governance. Whether you are building a simple token-based voting system or integrating advanced features (like **Fission**’s AI governance, specialized quorums, or timed meta-transactions), OpenZeppelin’s architecture provides a secure, modular foundation.

**Fission** extends this foundation to incorporate AI-driven delegate logic, transparent logging, and fully autonomous voting when desired. We recommend carefully reviewing all roles, delaying periods, and customization points to strike the right balance between decentralization, security, and administrative efficiency.
